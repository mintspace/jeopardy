"What is Jeopardy!?"
Jeopardy! is one of the longest running game shows in American history. It has been running for 36 years, and contestants have earned millions of dollars since it first aired. Ken Jennings alone won 2.5 million dollars on his historic 74 game hot streak. For trivia nerds out there, it is possibly the best game show ever created.
